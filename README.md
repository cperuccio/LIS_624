# LIS_624
Systems Librarianship

## 2026-02-09 - Systems Librarianship

Goal: To understand how GitHub works

Context: I'm taking the LIS 624 class with Dr. Burns.
 
Steps: I'm listening to the lecture as I work.

Results: I've successfully pushed changes from nano to my repository

Verification: I see the update in GitHub.

## 2026-02-10 - An update

I still can't figure out why ssh authentication kept failing for my first repository, so I've created a new one. As a reminder, here are the commands to use in order to push changes from my text editor to this repository:

* `git add name_of_entry.nd`
* `git commit -m "commit message here"`
* `git push origin main`
* `git status`

## Module 2: Check-In (2026-02-10):

Here's how I'm using my repository so far:

* To take note of commands I'll return to
* To document my progress throughout the course
* To make changes/edits in nano and to check how they would appear if published on GitHub
